# Reinforcement Learning for flexible wall design automation (in-development)

This project aims to automate the cantilever design of flexible retaining walls using Reinforcement Learning.

The environment is simulated using an Oasys Frew numerical model and the [Open AI Gym toolkit](https://gym.openai.com/) is used for facilitating the interaction with the RL agent.

The algorithm currently in experimentation is Deep Q-Learning, and its implementation is based on this [paper](https://deepmind.com/research/publications/playing-atari-deep-reinforcement-learning).
